namespace Eccube\Controller\Tutorial;

use Eccube\Application;
use Eccube\Controller\AbstractController;

class CrudController extends AbstractController
{

    public function index(Application $app)
    {
        return $app->render('Tutorial/crud_top.twig');★修正箇所(コメント部と、echo、exitを削除)
    }
}
```

-  I will explain simply about Controller and Method  

    1. Paramter : $app
        - In $app,class that is used in EC-CUBE, has been storing.
        - Correction is that content which is set in Application.php/ServiceProvider become structure, which is instanted, used when implementing.
        - Here,I don't explain in detail, but remember that you just call many functions from [$app] to structure Application
    1. Name space : use Eccube\Application;
        - In order to use [$app] that explained in 1., you have to specify name space out of scope of class
        - If say simply, I will tell you place for storing class that use for controller. を教えてあげるという事です。
        - Path that specify in Name space will be different based on class which use, but in case use class that exist in [/src/Eccube], please specify relative path from [Eccube] (At the beginning, no need [\])
    1. Name space : use Eccube\Controller\AbstractControler;
        - I will set parent class of controller based on reason same above
    1. $app->render([表示したいTwigのパス] (path of Twig which want to display)
        - If transfer path of Twig into [render] as parameter, Twig of target will be analyzed, and converted into html.
        - Normally,as return value of method of controller, if let return value of render as like that and [return],html that was converted, will be returned, screen is displayed.
        - About path that specify as [引数(parameter)], [/src/Eccube/Resource/template/] is setting as route path
        - Route path is setting when finished initialization of Application.php
        - In case of Controller of Admin side,[/admin/] of folder above becomes target, 
           In case of User screen, [/default/] becomes route folder.

#### Confirm the display content

- Try accessing in browser i

    1. Please input「http://[ドメイン + インストールディレクトリ] into URL of browser 

    1. Contents which was described in

        - Header and Footer has not displayed yet, but current status is exactly.
        - The display setting of Header and footer will conduct later.

![twigで文字表示](/images/img-tutorial2-view-rendar.png)(Display text by twig)

### Gather this chapter

- Contents volume had also increased, so I will gather content of chapter
- I conducted the following part in this chapter

1. Copy the existing Controller to create new controller
1. Copy the existing Twig to create new Twig
1. I explained the thing that based on Controller /Twig to gather into the relating folder.
1. I explained that $app is transfered as parameter of method of controller,many functions have been stored.
1. I explained that by converting Twig into html by render,set to be returned value of method, screen will be drawn.
